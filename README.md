# AVL Tree Implementation in Java
This repository contains a simple implementation of an AVL Tree in Java, focusing specifically on left-right rotations to maintain tree balance. AVL Trees are self-balancing binary search trees where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most one for any node.




## Features
Node Insertion: Insert nodes into the AVL tree while maintaining its balanced property.
Tree Rotations: Perform left-right rotations to rebalance the tree when necessary.
In-order Traversal: Traverse the tree in in-order sequence to display the nodes.


## Deployment

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

# Running the Code
